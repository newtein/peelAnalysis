# Peel Analysis
This repository consists code for Peel Analysis i.e. an out-of-the-box concept that dealt with finding meaning from the meaningless. The project aims to use noise in data that is often discarded to derive meaningful associations between variables.

## Research Abstract

Associational analysis is essential for understanding the underlying system and making predictions on its behaviour. While calculating correlations between data has been central to the field for the past century, we studied if the high frequency component of data, which is often discarded as noise, can be used effectively for studying associational inference. We designed experiments in python 3.5 to conduct this study. By varying amplitude, density, frequency and stochasticity of waves, we explored the reason why and when peel works and also the limitations of the approach. We observed that irrespective of being noisy or meaningless, the high frequency component, which we refer to as the peel, rarely suggests false associations, reveals new associations and is more suitable for phase alignment due to its high stochasticity. We also observed that to utilize the advantages of peel correlation, it needs to be separated from the overall data as peel has a much lower amplitude than the latter. We applied the approach to an electroencephalogram dataset and a pollution dataset of California and reached the same conclusions. We expect our study to promote the utilization of the high frequency component for associational analysis in all branches of science.
